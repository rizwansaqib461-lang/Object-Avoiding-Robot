# Object-Avoiding-Robot
Arduino-based autonomous object avoiding robot using ultrasonic sensor and motor driver.
# Object Avoiding Robot 🤖

## Overview
The Object Avoiding Robot is an Arduino-based autonomous system designed to detect obstacles in its path and avoid collisions without human intervention.
The robot uses an ultrasonic sensor to continuously measure the distance of nearby objects and makes real-time decisions to change its direction when an obstacle is detected.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to understand the fundamentals of robotics, sensor integration, and motor control by developing a simple autonomous robot capable of navigating its environment.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)  
- Motor Driver Module (L298N)  
- DC Motors  
- Robot Chassis  
- Rechargeable Battery  
- Jumper Wires  
  -Buck convertor
  -Servo motor (sg90)
## Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor emits sound waves and calculates the distance of obstacles based on the echo received.
When an object is detected within a predefined distance, the Arduino processes the data and sends control signals to the motor driver to stop, turn, or move in an alternate direction, allowing the robot to avoid obstacles efficiently.

## Key Features
